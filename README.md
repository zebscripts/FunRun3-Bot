# Script for the android game Fun Run 3: Arena

This is basically me trying to make my phone play for me in this fun little game. When the script starts, it opens the game, waits until it's able to play, clicks play on practice mode and then tries to run a random map. Surprisingly it actually works quite well, only the ducking part is hard. Plus it's really slow. But cmon, first time doing this, proud of myself...!

Tested on a rooted Samusung Galaxy S7 (SM-G930F). Run script with [BusyBox](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jrummy.busybox.installer)!
